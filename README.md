# Kaggle

My Kaggle scripts and kernels

Each folder corresponds a dataset. They contain the data (when the files aren't too big), the scripts I used to plan my analyses and the .Rmd files corresponding to the R Notebooks.

Unfortunately some of the text in old files and old commits might be in Portuguese. More recent analyses are 100% in English.
