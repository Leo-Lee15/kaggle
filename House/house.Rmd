My goal with this analysis is to find out whether Brazilian deputies
have been using their reimbursement rights inadequately.

These reimbursements are called Quota for the Exercise of Parliamentary
Activity and are "[a quota] destined to pay for expenses exclusively
linked to the execise of parliamentary activity". Therefore, as far as
I could tell, there are two main ways we could detect an improper claim
for reimbursement (given the available data):
* If the refund category is suspicious
* If the time component of the refund is suspicious

## Dissemination of Parliamentary Activity
